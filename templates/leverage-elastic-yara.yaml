# This template implements several things to immediately leverage a free YARA ruleset
# - enables YARA related extensions
# - subscribes to the Elastic Protection YARA Rules on Github
#   - https://github.com/elastic/protections-artifacts/tree/main/yara/rules
# - enables background scanning of endpoints using the Elastic ruleset
# - enables a series of relevant D&R rules for leveraging YARA against files and processes
#
# WARNING: This will overwrite any existing YARA SCANNERS you have configured.
